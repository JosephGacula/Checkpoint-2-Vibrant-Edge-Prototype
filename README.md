## Game Pitch (Updated)
Ever wonder what a cross between Megaman X and Splatoon would play like? Try Vibrant Edge! This is a fast-paced 2D action platformer where you play as a Ninja with color coded weapons fighting against color coded enemies. Rush through levels, defeat enemies, and earn that S rank. The world is counting on you to wipe the canvas of evil clean.

## Game Synopsis (Updated)
Vibrant Edge is a fast-paced 2D action platformer. You play as Hex, a ninja who wields his sword, the vibrant edge. This is the only weapon capable of defeating color-coded demons that have started spawning. This game’s unique mechanic is applying a color to your weapon. Using the right stick, you would flick it in a direction corresponding to a 6-sided color wheel on screen. To defeat enemies, you must select a color corresponding to what an enemy is, shoot and weaken them with a paint gun, and then go in for a kill with the vibrant edge. Different enemies will require different combinations of shooting and slicing. The objective is to defeat these enemies while making your way to the end of the stage. At the end, you are rewarded a rank based on your performance. This factors in your stage time, deaths, bonuses like killing multiple enemies at once or number of enemies killed without taking damage, etc. This rank encourages the player to optimize their gameplay upon replay.
