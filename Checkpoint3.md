Player 1: The controls were not intuitive. It was not difficult and there were not any moments that felt hard. Didn’t feel like playing longer. Felt pretty bug free. Running around. The game objectives were not that clear. No, it’s just not my type of game. 

Player 2:  There was too much reading and there were grammatical errors. The controls were kind of intuitive but not really. Not too difficult it was frustrating not being able to double jump to the highest platform. The four shoots didn’t kill the boxes. Felt like need to shoot and slash to kill box. Wanted headband color change when shooting different bullets/slashes. Maybe counter comes down instead. Was fun-ish, not my type of game. Can’t make it more fun. Game objectives were clear. Would not play again. 

Player 3: It would be nice if I could see what color I had equipped. Instructions for destroying each box should be changed to say shoot THEN slash, both need to happen. Knocking boxes off the platforms restarted the game, probably because the objective wasn’t met, but that should be mentioned as well. Controls were fine, but jumping into the side of a platform/box resulted in getting stuck unless you let go of the controls/moved in the other direction. Game objective was clear, but the goal of the game is too simple and doesn’t make me want to continue playing. Could be improved if its more challenging and has something like more levels so it has continued playability. Overall it’s an interesting concept but I wouldn’t play it again, it just is not preferred game type. 

Summary: 
They all felt like instructions for killing enemies seemed unintuitive and that there could be better wording for how to kill them. There was a bug where running into a wall would leave you stuck there and wouldn’t let go until you let go. Visual feedback was not good because we weren’t able to tell when the sprite was shooting red vs blue vs green from headband color. No animation to tell if enemy is taking damage. 

Summary with teammate: 
There seemed to be similar sentiment across all game testers about most features. For all testers, they complained about controls being too sensitive and physics problems of players. My testers took quite a while to figure out how to kill enemies because of unclear instructions of how to kill the boxes because it needed 4 hits and 1 slash to get them, so a better tutorial is needed. Both touched on how the color change of the sprite would help them identify what kind of gun they are shooting to know which enemy to kill. The objective seemed too easy for all testers and they would like more depth on what to do and visuals.
