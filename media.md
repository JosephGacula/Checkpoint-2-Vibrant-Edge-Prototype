Common Uses of Audio
The main media items for games are sound effects and music. Sound effects provide audio feedback for player actions like gunshots, slashing enemies, and opening chests or doors. Music plays in the background to set the mood and keep the player engaged during gameplay.
Sound Effects
Description: A sound effect triggers whenever the player performs an action. Different actions get different sounds—gunshots, melee attacks, door opens, etc. This creates immediate audio feedback for every player choice.
Pros: Players stay more engaged because they hear the impact of each action. The audio reinforces what they're doing on screen, making the game feel more responsive and immersive. This keeps players interested and playing longer.
Cons: Creating custom sound effects is difficult and time-consuming. Purchasing royalty-free sound assets costs money, which may not fit the budget. Finding free sounds that fit the game's style and quality is challenging.
Music
Description: Background music plays during gameplay to set the tone and atmosphere. Different music tracks can play for different situations (combat vs. exploration, victory vs. defeat).
Pros: Music keeps players engaged and makes the game feel more complete and professional. It creates emotional investment in what's happening on screen. Free or affordable royalty-free music is easier to find than high-quality sound effects.
Cons: Music can distract from sound effects if not mixed properly. Finding music that fits the game's style takes time. Setting up music to loop correctly requires some coding work.
Summary
Sound effects and music are the two main ways to engage players through audio. Sound effects make actions feel impactful, while music keeps the game interesting. Using both together creates a much better gaming experience.
